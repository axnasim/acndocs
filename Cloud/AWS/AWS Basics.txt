AWS Benefits
cost savings
no upfront investments
flexible capacity/resources as you need
speed agility/on-demand provisioning
global multiple zones

Security/Network/Servers/Storage

Application security is a goal to decreasing the time to implement production changes
The threat environment is increasing rapidly
Most vulnerabilities that are exploited are known and organizations don't take them seriously
You are only as secure as the env you are operating in

EC2-Elastic Compute Cloud
app/web/db/game/mail/media/catalog/file/proxy servers
process-choose region->AMI->Instance-type-HW->network->storage->keypairs->Connect
General/Compute/Accelerated/Storage/Memory

App Load Balancer
added features include-supported protocols/access logs/health checks/cloudwatch metrics
setup routing rules based on port, listeners and register target groups

Simple Storage Service
API for storing and getting data
S3 associated with region
scale to handle high volume
Access via aws cli/aws sdks/aws console
data in s3 can be replicated in another region
can use versioning

EBS-Elastic Block Store
Storage unit for EC2 instances
HDD/SSD
Data replicated in all availability zones

CloudFront
connected to edge locations globally
cache content close client CDN
request routed to nearest edge for faster delivery

Data Pipeline
Helps move data within AWS
Features-tasks, tasks runner, pipeline, pipeline definition(data source/activities/schedule/preconditions)
compatible storage services-S3/RDS/DynamoDB/Redshift
e.g-daily task to copy web server log files from EC2->S3 then analyzed by EMR weekly for traffic reports
Used for ETL/data backups/EMR jobs/importing data

Snowball Edge
transfer huge amounts data in/out of AWS
100TB capacity
high data transfer rates

CloudFormation
Automates applications for AWS resources
Create/Update/Delete stacks
Features-templates & permissions

WorkSpaces
Managed Desktop computing service managed in cloud for remote workers/students/developers/graphic apps

AWS ElasticCache
fully managed in-memory cache for Redis and Memcached
AppServer-->ElastiCache-->Nodes-->Redis & Memcached
lazy loading-cache hit to find data in EC-->data get from DB(cache miss)-->app writes data to EC
write through-data written to EC-->DB updated with data from EC
adding TTL helps performance and app queries DB for data

DynamoDB
DB table noSQL service
store as many items as possible

Aurora
DB mySQL & postgres relationship DB engine
managed service
backups to S3, resilient design
multiple AZones

RedShift
Fully managed datawarehouse
Run complex analytic queries
S3 & DynamoDB

Shared Responsibility Model
Security and Compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer.
